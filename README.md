# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

As part of The Odin Project, this is a showcase of a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written using HTML and JavaScript.

# Now with UI!

The first part of this project was to implement the game logic so that players can use the console to select options and eventually win the game. However, the next part of the project included designing and creating a simple user interface to make it more like a web-app or game. Both options are available as different branches in this repo.
